Sensors:
1- flash with wifi manager
2- connect to sensor's AP
3- set ssid and password of gateway
4- sensors connects to gateway and sends data in the following way:
    HTTP POST:
        Body: (this can be a byte array)
            sensor_id: (could be MAC address, access token, ...)
            value1:
            value2:

Gateway:
1- flash with wifi manager
2- connect to gateways AP
3- set ssid and password of internet router
4- gateway connects to server and gets its configuration and the configuration of
   sensors that are going to send data to it. Here is an example gateway configuration:
   {
    "devices": [
        {
            "name": "esp-sensor1",
            "data": [
                {
                    "name": "temperature",
                    "type": "double"
                },
                {
                    "name": "humidity",
                    "type": "double"
                },
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "esp-sensor2",
            "data": [
                {
                    "name": "luminosity",
                    "type": "int"
                }
            ]
        }
        ]
    }

5- The gateway creates endpoints for each device and sets up proper handlers for each of them.
6- Aggregate and process sensor data into a larger array and send it to server
